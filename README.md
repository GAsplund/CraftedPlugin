# CraftedPlugin  
A plugin made to reenact functionality of the CraftedMovie server from 2014.
Made for the 2023 CraftedMovie reunion server.

## Features  
- `/title` - Sets a prefix before your username
- `/color` - Sets your username color
- `/port` - Teleports you to the `2023_PORT` world. This may become configurable later
- Port buttons - Allows buttons to teleport you to a specific location
- Cow obituary - Lets everyone in the same world know when a cow has been killed
- "World color" - Custom placeholder that allows you to specify a color in a user's prefix

## Requirements  
- Vault is needed in order for `/title`, `/color` and world colors to work
- `/spawn` relies (regrettably) on Multiverse and teleports you to the world spawn

## Limitations  
- Worlds and locations are currently hardcoded. This may change down the road
- The plugin is only tested for 1.19.4 but may work for other versions as well
